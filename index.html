            <h3>27 January 2019 - Home, Travelling, RPG, and Fantasy</h3>
            =======================================================================================================
            <div>
                <strong>'Home is where the heart is.'</strong>
                <p>Di usiaku yang sudah hampir menginjak kepala dua, aku masih belum menemukan tempat yang 'klop' untuk hatiku.</p>
                <p>Perhaps I never will.</p>

                <p>Sejak SMP, setelah my so-called 'forced maturation' di SD, aku mulai membaca banyak novel-novel fiksi.
                Mulai dari Harry Potter, Inheritance Tetralogy, The Host (Yap, punyanya Stephanie Meyer, don't judge me T_T), The Hunger Games, Artemis Fowl, 
                Percy Jackson, dsb. plus most recently Crazy Rich Asian.
                Ditambah numerous Anime dan Light Novel, mayoritas fantasy dan historical (that includes alternate).
                Lalu video games, pertama dari gamesnya PopCap (Zuma, Sally Salon, Insaniquarium, Diner Dash, dsb.) lalu ke FPS (Counter Strike warnet deket rumah, will never forget you)
                multiplayernya Battlefield 2 dan COD MW3 (please forgive my obnoxious teen self back then, Kaskus BF2 and MNTH), dan akhirnya ke RPG macam TES, ME, dan DA
                serta 4X plus Grand Strategynya Paradox.</p>

                <p>Semua yang dihighlight share a common thing. Mereka semua alternate reality bagiku. Something that 'could be' for me.
                Sejak aku mulai melihat dunia ini abu-abu saat kelas 2 SD (I always thought highly of myself), mereka semua merepresentasikan segalanya yang could go right in my life.
                They offer me different perspective, different point of view, hal yang bisa mendistraksi diri dari hal lainnya yang aku benci dari realita disekelilingku.
                Ultimately, mereka semua cuma fiksi. They will never suffice for me, because I will never be able to experience it myself.</p>

                <p>Mulailah aku memutar diri ke travelling. Untuk seseorang yang kelihatannya sangat relucant to go out, keinginanku untuk berpergian itu tinggi sekali.
                Namun, berpergian yang aku inginkan berbeda dari kebanyakan orang. Diriku tak mau berpergian hanya untuk bersenang-senang sesaat, ke tempat yang familiar,
                lalu kembali lagi ke realita yang sama.</p>

                <h4>Tidak.</h4>

                <h4>Aku ingin mencari tempat untuk hatiku.</h4>

                <p>Pernah aku bercerita ke temanku bahwa grafik kemauanku untuk berpergian dengan jarak membentuk kurva cembung ke bawah, dengan kemauan sebagai Y-axis dan jarak sebagai X-axis.
                That is not strictly true. The reason that I crave for travelling to far away place and utterly despise going to nearby places is that I want to travel because I am searching for a home.
                Pergi ke Pantai Pandawa, GWK, atau other places di Bali tidak akan menghasilkan apapun bagiku. Tidak ada yang berbeda dengan realita 18 tahun hidupku.
                Bali is not where my heart is. Mungkin benar sebelum aku SD atau saat masa-masa indah SMA. Tapi tidak untuk sekarang. Semua kenangan indah telah berpencar, hanya meninggalkan bayangnya, hilang sudah segala yang mampu menahan memori buruk.
                Jakarta and Depok, on the other hand, belum 100% 'klop'. Masih terlalu singkat. One of the reasons kenapa aku senang sekali tiap kali diajak menelusuri Jakarta.</p>

                <p>Ultimately, I know that my heart will never entirely here. Bila ada portal menuju tempat lain yang tiba-tiba muncul didepanku, bukan tidak mungkin aku akan meninggalkan segalanya dan masuk kedalamnya.</p>

            <h3>12 April 2018 - Shelter</h3>
            =======================================================================================================
            <div>
                <h3>Shelter</h3>

                <p>Porter Robinson & Madeon : Shelter. When it's music video appears on my YouTube Home (it's what recommendation called before), i thought
                it was just some cringy anime video (despite being an avid anime lovers at the time). An accidental swipe from my index finger and suddenly 
                i was swept by a soothing and melancolic melody. I may have fallen in love with it at the time, but due to my bad hearing and immaturity, i didn't
                understand the song very much and immediately left it alone after listening once.</p>

                <p>A year later, on an English class, my teacher plays the song in the class and asked us to contemplate about it's meaning. At first, i am shocked 
                when i saw it again after a long time. It stirred my feeling again, and i was so distracted that when my teacher asked what we thought, i didn't 
                say anything. None in the class say anything, and then my teacher tell us of her interpretation of the song. I am distraught, began to contemplate 
                a lot, but then dismissed it from my mind, even thought there was a nagging feeling on my mind.</p>

                <p>At 07.54, 12th April 2018, after a month of feeling an all-time low in my life, i saw it again on my recommendation. I immediately plays it while 
                walking to the campus. And again it stirred my feeling again. My mind keeps wandering for the day. It keeps reminding me of what is my purpose here. 
                At 22.17, on the ride to my kost, i am reminded. That i am here "go forward", while "leaving behind my home", to do something greater, and "i know 
                i'm not alone", because i know they "watching over me", and that "something greater", is meant to "give shelter" toward many people, and i "don't need 
                to be known", and the knowledge that that "something greater" will be "carried on by them" is enough.</p>

                <h4>12.11 AM, 13th April 2018. One day and eleven minutes after my 19th birthday, i found that strength again.</h4>

            <h3>28 March 2018 - Friendship</h3>
            =======================================================================================================
            <div>
                <h3>Friendship</h3>

                <p>If you ask me how many friends i have, i will tell you that it's countable with both hands. Yeah, that's not many compared
                to a lot of people, but first you have to know that my definition of "friend" is very strict. While lots of people
                say someone is their friend when they only met once or they were classmate back in Junior High, i don't. I will not 
                consider someone a friend simply by the virtue of mutual class. I will not say someone is a friend when we work together 
                in a group for a time and rarely talks after that. My definition of "friend" is a lot stricter than that. What people 
                say as a friend, i say an acquintance. What people say as a close friend, i say a friend. You can say that a person
                i know is either an acquintance or a close friend. Together with my introverted nature, it's not surprising 
                that i have much less friends than normal people.</p>

                <p>Why's that? Why is my definition of "friend" is so strict? Bear with me for a while because this will be a (relatively) 
                long story to why the definition is so strict.</p>

                <p>When you see my history with people, you'll see an abnormal pattern. Majority of my friends is people who i hate at first,
                then somehow become friends (close friend, if other normal people see it).</p>

            <h3>24 March 2018 - Reality, Fantasy, and The Wandering Inn</h3>
            =======================================================================================================
            <div>
                <h3>Reality, Fantasy, and The Wandering Inn</h3>

                <p>There are numerous kind of fantasy fiction, such as Urban Fantasy where fantastic elements emerge in
                a modern setting, Hard Fantasy with it's emphasis on rational and realistic world, Historical Fantasy that 
                merge fantastic elements with historical narrative, etc. But when we ask people to describe fantasy,
                it's usually not far off from dragons, dwarves, elves, monster, and so on. That is, High (or Epic) fantasy.</p>

                <p>High Fantasy is perhaps the most common form of fantasy fiction, usually influenced by elements from it's progenitor,
                the legendary Lord of the Rings and it's army of clone works. Most fans of fantasy fiction dreams of living in wonderful
                and exciting world depicted there. I think so too. Or rather, i thought so too.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>How High Fantasy usually parallel Medieval Age</li>
                    <li>How an Average Joe won't survive in such world</li>
                    <li>Points that the fantasy isn't as exciting as depicted</li>
                    <li>Brings The Wandering Inn as a realistic slice-of-life slash fantasy that
                        depict correctly that such world is dangerous</li>
                    <li>Explain that stories are exciting because the removed the boring part that characters experience</li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Conclude that while fantasy is, while not so exciting now, still more exciting than our reality,
                            it is simply not feasible for us to live there, and points that we as human beings always desire what
                            we don't have, not that different from Medieval ages people that maybe want a world like ours, and we
                            have to accept that.
                        </p>

                who sit in class XII-5 in the past. I'm changing. For better or worse, we'll see.</p>
